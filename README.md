This repository contains a Weather Fetch Card application that utilizes API calls to retrieve and display the current weather conditions for a specified city. The application allows users to input the name of a city, and it fetches real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The user-friendly interface presents the information in an organized and visually appealing card format, making it easy to read and understand. This project demonstrates how to work with APIs, manage asynchronous data retrieval, and enhance user interaction through dynamic content updates, providing a practical example of integrating web services into a frontend application.
